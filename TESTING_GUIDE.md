# BasePass Testing Guide üß™

Quick guide to test your BasePass MVP end-to-end.

## Prerequisites

‚úÖ Smart Contract Deployed: `0x65AaFd972B45dd0108BFeDc1830C56a95fc52310`  
‚úÖ Frontend Running: http://localhost:3000  
‚úÖ MetaMask Connected to Base Sepolia  
‚úÖ Base Sepolia ETH in wallet  

---

## Test Sequence

### 1. Start the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### 2. Connect Your Wallet

1. Click "Connect Wallet" in the header
2. Approve MetaMask connection
3. Ensure you're on Base Sepolia network (Chain ID: 84532)
4. Your address should appear in the header

### 3. Mint a Passport (User Flow)

1. On the home page, you should see "Passport Status"
2. If you don't have a passport, click "Mint Passport"
3. Approve the transaction in MetaMask
4. Wait for confirmation (~2-5 seconds)
5. You should see "üéâ Passport minted successfully!"
6. Click the BaseScan link to view the transaction

**Expected Result:** Your passport status shows "‚úì You own a BasePass Passport!"

### 4. View Your Passport

1. Navigate to "My Passport" page
2. You should see your passport card with:
   - Token ID
   - Your wallet address
   - Event stamps section (empty if no events yet)

### 5. Create an Event (Admin Flow)

1. Navigate to "Admin" page
2. Fill in the "Create New Event" form:
   - **Event Name:** "Base Builders Meetup"
   - **Description:** "Monthly meetup for Base developers"
   - **Icon URL:** (optional) Leave blank or add any URL
   - **Signer Address:** Click "Use my address" to auto-fill

3. Click "Create Event"
4. Approve transaction in MetaMask
5. Wait for confirmation
6. You should see "‚úÖ Event created successfully!"

**Expected Result:** Event appears in "Your Events" list

### 6. Generate QR Code

1. Still on Admin page, click on your newly created event
2. It should highlight with a blue border
3. On the right side, you'll see "QR Code Generator"
4. Set "QR Code Expiration" (default 24 hours is fine)
5. Click "Generate QR Code"
6. Approve the signature request in MetaMask (this is just signing, not a transaction - free!)
7. A QR code should appear
8. Click "Download QR Code" to save it

**Expected Result:** QR code displayed with expiration time

### 7. Claim a Stamp (Complete the Loop!)

1. Click "Show QR Data (for testing)" to see the JSON data
2. Copy the entire JSON object (it looks like this):
   ```json
   {
     "eventId": 1,
     "nonce": "0x...",
     "expiration": "...",
     "signature": "0x...",
     "chainId": 84532
   }
   ```

3. Go to "My Passport" page
4. Scroll to "Claim Event Stamp" section
5. Paste the JSON data into the text area
6. Click "Parse QR Data"
7. You should see "‚úì QR Data Valid" with event details
8. Click "Claim Stamp"
9. Approve the transaction in MetaMask
10. Wait for confirmation
11. You should see "üéâ Stamp claimed successfully!"

**Expected Result:** 
- Transaction confirmed on BaseScan
- Event stamp shows as ‚úÖ in your stamps grid

### 8. Verify Everything Worked

1. Go back to "My Passport"
2. In the "Event Stamps" section, your event should show:
   - Green border
   - ‚úÖ checkmark
   - Event name and description

3. On BaseScan, verify transactions:
   - Passport mint: https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/YOUR_ADDRESS
   - Event creation
   - Stamp claim

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Insufficient funds"
**Solution:** Get more Base Sepolia ETH from faucet:
- https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-ethereum-sepolia-faucet

### Issue: "Wrong network"
**Solution:** Switch MetaMask to Base Sepolia:
- Network Name: Base Sepolia
- RPC URL: https://sepolia.base.org
- Chain ID: 84532

### Issue: "You are not the authorized signer"
**Solution:** When creating an event, make sure to use YOUR wallet address as the signer. Click "Use my address" button.

### Issue: "QR code has expired"
**Solution:** Generate a new QR code with a longer expiration time.

### Issue: "Stamp already claimed"
**Solution:** This is expected! You can't claim the same stamp twice. Create a new event to test again.

### Issue: "Invalid signature"
**Solution:** 
- Make sure the QR code was generated by the authorized signer
- Check that you copied the complete JSON data
- Verify you're on the correct network (Base Sepolia)

## Advanced Testing

### Test Multiple Events

1. Create 2-3 different events
2. Generate QR codes for each
3. Claim stamps for all of them
4. Verify all stamps appear in your passport

### Test Expiration

1. Generate a QR code with 1 hour expiration
2. Save the JSON data
3. Wait 1 hour (or manually change the expiration timestamp to a past date)
4. Try to claim - should fail with "QR code has expired"

### Test Unauthorized Signer

1. Create Event A with Address X as signer
2. Try to generate QR code with Address Y (different wallet)
3. Should show warning: "You are not the authorized signer"

### Test Without Passport

1. Use a fresh wallet address (no passport)
2. Try to claim a stamp
3. Should show: "You need to mint a passport first"
